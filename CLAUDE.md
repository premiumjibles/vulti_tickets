Each sub-repo has its own CLAUDE.md. This file applies to all.

## Architecture
Business logic goes in vultisig-sdk, not app/CLI/backend layers.

## Code Style
- Biome for TS/JS — check each repo's package.json for the correct package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm)
- gofmt + golangci-lint for Go

## Safety
Changes to key material, signing flows, or address derivation require extra scrutiny. Flag in PR descriptions.
